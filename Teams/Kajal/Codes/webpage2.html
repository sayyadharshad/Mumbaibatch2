<p>Raw chocolate and cocoa are known to boost energy and help brain function. Sluggishness and fatigue are often a common symptom of a magnesium deficiency in the body. Stay away from processed chocolate, as it’s not as healthy for you as cocoa, which can also treat irritability.</p>
<hr><br>
<p>Red pepper has been recommended for providing pregnant women with an energy boost. Red peppers contain iron and can increase the body’s heat production and intake of oxygen. They are also high in vitamin C containing nearly 300% of the daily recommendation while pregnant.</p>
<hr><br>
<p>Oats are rich in calcium, magnesium, vitamin E and vitamin B, potassium and protein and are a great energy boost. Why not start-the-day with a bowl of porridge to beat morning tiredness. Oats can also be beneficial if you’re suffering with stress and can help improve your skin.</p>
